How to make Red Velvet Cake step by step......


step1.  first preheat your own to 350 F(176 C). Next lets make our cake batter. start by creaming your butter and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.

step2.  Now we add in our eggs one at a time. so drop one egg in ,mix,once the egg is completely incorporated do the other egg. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well with a spatula.

step3.   Now we add in our cocoa powder. it is a good idea to run it through some kind of a sifter. Cocoa powder tends to get a bit lumby.then mix again and scrape the sides as needed. Throughout this whole process we dont want to our mix, just untill things are incorporated .If we mix too much we will add too much air into the Batter which can cause air pockets in our cake.

 step4.  Now add in our vanils extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar . If you dont have buttermilk you can make some by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and then let it sit out for 10 to 15 minutes. stir the vinegar and vanilla extract untill combined.

 step5.  Now we add in our all oil to the buttermilk mixture.Next add in about 2 to 2 and 1/2 TABLESPOON of red coloring liguid.Then stir , untill the ixture is a nice red color. see that mixture aside for now.

 step6.  Next we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour. You can use cake flour or all purpose flour. Cake flour tends to a work a little bit better , but all purpose works great too. Use a whisk to combine those ingredients.

 step7.  Now we will add in about half of our food  oloring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture,thn turn on the mixture and mix untill just combined.Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the prrocess until all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red Velvet cake batter.

 step8.  Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pans with egual amounts of cake batter.Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust them with cocoa powder on flour and I always add a little round cut out of parchement paper on tyhe bottom too as an added precaution , and my nonstick pans are great , but I like to over do it.lol Also it is good idea to lightly tap the pans with the batter in it , this will allow any cake bubbles to rise to the top , which helps to prevents air pocket , but sometimes it is unavoidable and you just get them, a combination of opver mixing , etc.But it wont effect the taste of the cake at all! So dont worry about it. I never do. lol now bake those cakes for 20 to 30 minuts unti. when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

 step9.  Now after the cakes comes out of the oven lets leave them alone and allow to cool in their panes for about 10 minutes.After hat we can remove them from theirs panes , remove the parchement paper and then let the cakes cool completely on the rack. Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them chill, which helps with the Froasting, or just go onto the froasting step now, it's totally up to you!!

 step10.  Well now it is time to make our frosting , we will be using just a few ingredients , cream cheese, butter,vanilla extract , and of course powered sugar (confectioners sugar).

 step11.  Now combine the cream cheese , butter, and vanilla extract into a large bowl and mix with a hand mixer untily nice and smooth usually takes a few minutes . Then slowly incorporate all of the powered sugar. You may need more or less depending on the consistency that you want .Next just remove the beaters. Froasting is ready to go. At this point if the freezing is still too runny add more powdered sugar , or just chill it for about 30 minutes before Froasting that cake.

 step12.  First we will trip the cake so it will be someWhat level.You can skip this step if you like. I just always use my bread Knife to cut the top off the bottom layer,if you want to use fondantI recommened cutting the top of the toplayer off as well, the end product will look a bit better.Next add a bunch of Froasting to the middle, then layer the top layer of cake on. Then cover that whole cake with Froasting.There are a variety of tools that you can use , I normally just use any cake spatula. Once done put the cake in the fridge for about 30 minutes. this is optional, but I like to do it , allows the Froasting to set a bit.

 step13.  Now I want to make a heart - shaped cake topper. To do that I take my heart cookie cutter and cut out a shape from the middle of that piece of cake that I have . Then just place it on top of your cake.

 step14.  Now take the rest of your leftover cake and crumble it up with your fingers. Then gently Apply it to do your cake sides or on top or skip this step.It is totally up to you how to do decorate your cake.Use a piping bag and piping Froasting around the top of your heart if you want.You are done!! Now place your cake in freeze for 2 to 3 hours before serving  Enjoy!
